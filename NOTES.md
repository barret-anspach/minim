Notes

So. Let's reset what the purpose of this project is.

High level goals
- Render reflowable scores from [WHAT IS THE FORMAT IN WHICH A SCORE IS DELIVERED??], taking into consideration
  - vertical alignment of both durational and display quanta


Score
- Saved to/read from JSON
  - [MNX](https://w3c.github.io/mnx/docs/)
- Edit b/w/o text/Markdown
  - Some kind of SVG-like set of string commands would be the most extensible
