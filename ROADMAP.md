# ROADMAP
Trying to get this project off the ground.

## Getting started
- [X] Add SMUFL font
- [X] Use Bravura's metadata.engravingDefaults to set font sizes and spacing values

## Towards a POC
- [X] Multi-staff system reflow
- [X] Refactor to "part-first" layout strategy rather than "measure-first" (as should really be the case, and as is the case for MNX)
- [X] Create (handwritten) examples of polymeter, so you know how to handle insertion points for non-proportional events (tim/key/cle/etc)
- [X] Polymeter supported (multiple concurrent time signatures)
- [ ] Multiple concurrent tempi supported

## POC
- [ ] Playback
- [ ] Parts
- [ ] Multiple versions of scores contained within same document
